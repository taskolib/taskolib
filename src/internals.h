 * Remove abort markers from the given error message and determine the cause of the error.
 *
 * If at least two abort markers are present, the message is truncated to the text between
 * the first two of these markers. Otherwise, all markers are simply removed.
 *
 * The cause of the error is determined as follows:
 * - If no marker was present, the message describes a "normal" error and
 *   ErrorCause::uncaught_error is returned.
 * - If the message contains one or more abort markers, it describes an abort request for
 *   the sequence. There are two different types of abort requests:
 *   - If there is an error message, this is considered an abort request (either by the
 *     user or by timeouts) and ErrorCause::aborted is returned.
 *   - If the error message is empty, this is considered an explicit termination request
 *     by the running script. The error message is set to a corresponding explanation
 *     ("Script called terminate_sequence()") and ErrorCause::terminated_by_script is
 *     returned.
 *
 * \returns a pair consisting of the (possibly) modified error message and of an
 *          ErrorCause.
