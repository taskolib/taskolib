 * Steps can be of different types (see Step::Type) - for instance, "action" steps hold a
 * script that can simply be executed, "if" steps hold a script that can be evaluated to
 * determine if a condition is fulfilled, "end" steps mark the closing of a block in a

     *            there is a Lua error during execution, if a timeout is encountered, or
