/**
 * Serialize Sequence with all of its Step 's as files.
 *
 * After serializing you will find the following structure:
 *
 * - the sequence label is extracted to a folder name, where underneath all steps are
 *  serialized. If the label has one of the following characters they are escaped to
 *  hexadecimal format: /\\:?*"'<>|$&. Moreover all control characters (<= 32) are
 *  converted to space character (' ').
 *
 * - underneath the sequence folder you will find the Step 's serialized in files. To
 *  differ the Step they are enumerated. Each filename starts with `step` followed by a
 *  consecutive step enumeration number followed by type. Since you can directly evaluate
 *  the step as a Lua script it has the extension `'.lua'`. The step numbering is filled
 *  with '0' to allow alphanumerical sorting.
 *
 *  Here is one example for the first step that has type `action`: `step_001_action.lua`
 *
 *  \note Remember that the libary only uses three digit for numbering. There is no
 *  guarantee for serializing more then 1000 Step 's in alphabetical order.
 *
 * - important Step parameters are exported to the beginning of the file as Lua
 *  comments. See ::serialize_step(const std::filesystem::path&, const Step&) for more
 *  information.
 *
 * @param path to store Sequence
 * @param sequence to be serialized
