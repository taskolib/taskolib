/**
 * A sequence of steps that can be modified and executed.
 *
 * A sequence is basically a list of \ref task::Step "Step" objects with some additional
 * functionality and information. For instance, a sequence has a human-readable label,
 * a list of maintainers, a unique ID, a timeout, and a "step setup script" that is
 * executed before each individual step.
 *
 * A sequence can be executed in the current thread with execute(). The most important
 * member functions for modifying the sequence are the following ones:
 *
 * -# push_back(): add a new step at the end
 * -# pop_back(): remove a step from the end
 * -# insert(): insert a step at an arbitrary position
 * -# assign(): assign a new step to an existing element
 * -# erase(): remove a step or a range of steps
 * -# modify(): modify a step inside the sequence via a function or function object
 *
 * \code {.cpp}
 * Sequence seq;
 * seq.push_back(Step{Step::type_try});
 * seq.push_back(Step{Step::type_action});
 * seq.push_back(Step{Step::type_catch});
 * seq.push_back(Step{Step::type_action});
 * seq.push_back(Step{Step::type_end});
 * // insert an action step at index 1
 * seq.insert(seq.begin() + 1, Step{Step::type_action});
 *
 * Context context;
 * auto maybe_error = seq.execute(context);
 * \endcode
 *
 * ## Additional information
 *
 * Beside the list of steps, a sequence carries additional information. The following
 * paragraphs give a coarse overview.
 *
 * ### Label
 *
 * A human-readable label that describes the function of the sequence. It may not contain
 * control characters like linebreaks, but can otherwise be chosen freely. The library and
 * user code are free to use the label as a basis for generating file, directory, and
 * similar names, but must take of the necessary character escaping. The label is not
 * unique and it might be empty.
 *
 * \see get_label(), set_label()
 *
 * ### Name
 *
 * While the label is meant for humans to read, the sequence name is a more
 * machine-friendly identifier for constrained uses such as filenames. The name may only
 * contain alphanumeric characters, the minus and underscore characters, and periods. It
 * can be up to 64 characters long, but may be empty.
 *
 * \see get_name(), set_name()
 *
 * ### Unique ID
 *
 * The unique ID (UID) is a 64-bit integer that is used to identify the sequence, as far
 * as possible, in a unique way. Upon construction of the sequence, a random UID is
 * generated. Although clashes are very unlikely, an external class like the
 * SequenceManager may take additional steps to ensure the uniqueness of the ID.
 *
 * \see get_unique_id(), set_unique_id()
 *
 * ### Maintainers
 *
 * The sequence carries a list of maintainers or sequence authors as a string. By default,
 * it is empty, and it can hold whatever information seems useful.
 *
 * \see get_maintainers(), set_maintainers()
 *
 * ### Step setup script
 *
 * The sequence contains a common setup script that is shared by all of its steps. It is
 * called automatically before the execution of the script from each step, just after
 * executing the lua_step_setup. It is typically used like a small library for defining
 * common functions or constants. The setup script is only executed for steps that
 * actually execute a script themselves (ACTION, IF, ELSEIF, WHILE).
 *
 * \see get_step_setup_script(), set_step_setup_script()
 *
 * ### Sequence timeout
 *
 * The sequence has a global timeout that starts counting down when execute() is called.
 * By default, it is set to infinity (i.e., no timeout).
 *
 * \see get_timeout(), set_timeout()
 *
 * ### Time of last execution
 *
 * The sequence stores the timestamp of when it was last executed.
 *
 * \see get_time_of_last_execution()

     * the entire sequence or just one of its steps:
     *
     * - If `opt_step_index == nullopt`, the function first performs a syntax check and
     *   throws an Error exception if it fails. Then, it executes the sequence step by
     *   step, following the control flow given by steps such as WHILE, IF, TRY, and so
     *   on. Disabled steps are ignored. The function returns when the sequence has
     *   finished or has stopped with an error.
     *
     * - If `opt_step_index` contains a step index, this function executes the single step
     *   identified by the index. As usual, both the step setup function (from the
     *   context) and the step setup script (from the sequence) are run before the step
     *   script. No verification of the entire sequence takes place, so that a single step
     *   can even be run if the logical structure of the sequence is faulty. For most

     *   sequence.

     *                 overwritten with the step setup script of the executed sequence.
     * \param comm_channel  Pointer to a communication channel. If this is a null pointer,
     *                 no messages are sent and no external interaction with the running
     *                 sequence is possible. Otherwise, messages for starting/stopping
     *                 steps and the sequence itself are sent and termination requests are

     *
     * \returns nullopt if the execution finished successfully, or an Error object if the
     *          script cannot be executed due to a syntax error or if it raises an error
