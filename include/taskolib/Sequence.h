 * A sequence of \ref task::Step "Step"s to be executed under a given Context.
 *
 * On executing a validation is performed to check if the steps are consistent. When a
 * fault is detected an Error is thrown including a precise error message about what
 * fails.
 *
 * To modify the sequence the following member functions are implemented:
 *
 * -# push_back(): add a new Step at the end
 * -# pop_back(): remove a Step from the end
 * -# insert(): insert a Step at an arbitrary position
 * -# assign(): assign a new Step to an existing element
 * -# erase(): remove a Step or a range of steps
 * -# modify(): modify a Step inside the sequence via a function or function object
 *

 * Sequence seq;
 * seq.push_back(Step{Step::type_try});
 * seq.push_back(Step{Step::type_action});
 * seq.push_back(Step{Step::type_catch});
 * seq.push_back(Step{Step::type_action});
 * seq.push_back(Step{Step::type_end});
 * // insert an action step at index 1
 * seq.insert(seq.begin() + 1, Step{Step::type_action});
 * \endcode
 *
 * ## Step setup script #
 *
 * The sequence can contains a common setup script that is shared by all of its steps. It
 * is called automatically before the execution of each step's script, just after
 * executing the lua_step_setup. It is typically used like a small library for defining
 * common functions or constants.
 *
 * The setup script is only executed for step types for which Step::executes_script()
 * returns true (ACTION, IF, ELSEIF, WHILE).
