/**
 * A context stores information that influences the execution of steps and sequences,
 * namely:
 * - A list of variables that can be im-/exported into steps.
 * - An initialization function (in C++) that is called on a Lua state before a step is
 *   executed.
 * - A step setup script (in Lua) that is executed before a step is executed. Global
 *   variables and functions defined in this step setup script can be accessed by the Lua
 *   script in the step. When a sequence is executed, this step setup script is
 *   overwritten with the one from the sequence.
 * - A callback that is invoked whenever a message is being processed by the execution
 *   engine (see below for details).
 *
 * <h3>Message callback function</h3>
 *
 * The Context contains a message_callback_function that is called once for each message
 * that is being processed by the execution engine in the main thread. By default, this
 * function will send the output of the Lua "print()" command and error messages to
 * stdout (see default_message_callback()). However, message_callback_function can also be
 * set to nullptr (to disable any special behavior) or to a custom function:
 * \code
 * void my_message_callback(const Message& msg)
 * {
 *     if (msg.get_type() == Message::Type::output)
 *         send_to_console(msg.get_text());
 *     else if (msg.get_type() == Message::Type::sequence_stopped_with_error)
 *         show_alert_box(msg.get_text());
 * }
 *
 * Context context;
 * context.message_callback_function = my_message_callback;
 * \endcode
 * The callback function receives a reference to the message that is being processed.
 * If a sequence is executed in the current thread (e.g. via Sequence::execute()), the
 * callback is executed whenever a message is generated. If the sequence is handed to an
 * Executor for parallel execution, the callback is run whenever the main thread has
 * received the message (i.e. typically within Executor::update()). Callbacks are never
 * executed on the worker thread.
