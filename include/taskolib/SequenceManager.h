 * ./sequence_1 <- folder name that represents the first sequence
 *    step_while_01.lua <- first step of sequence 1
 *    ...
 *    step_action_<n>.lua <- n-th step of sequence 1
 * ...
 * ./sequence_<m> <- folder name that represents the m-th sequence
 *    step_if_01.lua <- first step of sequence 1
 *    ...
 *    step_action_<n>.lua <- n-th step of sequence 1
 * \endcode
 *
 * Above we have as root path the folder '.'.
