/**
 * Extracts and creates from \a folder a Step and returns it. The filename must be a Lua
 * script and should have the extension 'lua'.
 *
 * It will throw an Error exception if an I/O error occurs on the external filename object
 * or the file does not exist.
 *
 * To load a Step it must consist of the following minimum properties:
 * \code
 * -- type: action \a or if \a or ...
 * -- label: < \a label \a description >
 * \endcode
 *
 * Optional are the following properties:
 * \code
 * -- use context variable names: [ \a variable1, ... ]
 * -- time of last modification: %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
 * -- time of last execution: %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
 * -- timeout: [infinity|< \a timeout \a in \a milliseconds >]
 * \endcode
 *
 * If one of the optional parameters is not set the following is provided as default:
 * - context variable names is an empty list
 * - time of last modification is set to a time stamp when loaded
 * - time of last execution is set to January 1st 1970
 * - timeout is set to 0s
 *
 * Here is one example of a stored Step \a step_001_while.lua :
 * \code
 * -- type: while
 * -- label: Is increment lower then 10?
 * -- use context variable names: [incr]
 * -- time of last modification: 2022-06-13 16:30:32
 * -- time of last execution: 2022-06-13 16:55:21
 * -- timeout: 60000
 * return incr < 10
 * \endcode
 *
 * The label is explicitly escaped on storing and unescaped on loading.
 *
 * \note \c '--' is a Lua comment and interpreted with special keywords to fill the Step
 * properties.
 * \note for time interpretation see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a>
 * \note if <tt>>time of last modification</tt> is not provided in the file it is set to
 * the time on loading the step.
 * \note the collection of context variable names can also be an empty list, ie. \c [] .
 *
 * \param folder from which the Step should be loaded.
 * \param folder from which the Step should be loaded.
 * \returns the deserialized Step object.
